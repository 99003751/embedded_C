Lab activity 1– GPIO
Write modular program to read the status of the switch and write high/low status to GPIO output pin
as per below table based upon API’s mentioned.
Switch-I Switch-II LED 1 state LED 2 state
open open LOW LOW
open close LOW HIGH
close open HIGH LOW
close close Toggle LED for
every 1 sec
Toggle LED for
every 1 sec
Below API or functions need to be designed to test application.


GPIOConfig(Pin, mode)
Purpose: The function is used to configure the mode of the pin.
Pin: The Atmega328P port pin which need to be configured.
Mode: direction of the pin in INPUT or OUTPUT. In case of INPUT, the mode is required to be
configured for PULLUP configuration along with INPUT.


GPIOPinRead(Pin)
Purpose: The function returns the state (0 or 1) of the input pin.
Pin: The Atmega328P port pin which need to be read.
Return value: 0 or 1


GPIOPinWrite(pin, state)
Purpose: The function is used to write LOW or HIGH state to GPIO pin.
Pin: The Atmega328P pin used to write LOW or HIGH state.
State: LOW or HIGH



Modular program guidelines:
GPIO.h: This file contains
function prototype declarations
defined macro
extern variable declaration if any
typedef for variables
GPIO.c: This file contains
Function definitions, variable definitions
Static functions declaration and definitions
Static variables, macros
The files need to be submitted in the zip folder having unique ID:
• Module Implementation files [.c files] and corresponding header files [.h files]
• Main program [.c file] to test as per problem statement
• .HEX file
• Simulation circuit [ .simu file]
